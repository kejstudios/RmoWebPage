    <h1>Jonah's Story</h1>
    <p>It's been about a month since Jonah's passing. The only comfort we have is that he's at peace now in heaven and no longer suffering. The day after the funeral, we went through a pile of his things that were left in our office. In his gym bag, we found some letters to a few of us and his journal. The journal explained how bad his mental health really was and that it was going on much longer than we knew. Within his journal were some separate pages that were titled "TELL MY STORY". </p>
	
	<p>We want to share Jonah's notes to hopefully help someone else that may be going through what he was going through. PLEASE SHARE THIS POST. We all need to start being a champion of mental health. Look out for each other and especially our kids.</p>
	
	<p>We miss you so much Jonah. I hope you are enjoying some good beach time, taking hikes through the mountains and hitting 300 yard drives right down the middle of the fairway. Fly high and see you on the other side kid. </p>
	
	<p>The following was written by Jonah, date unknown. </p>

	<p>Su*c!de timeline from my experience</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It starts with experiencing any of those symptoms to the point where it is causing serious problems in your life</li>
		<li>After a long time of that I began to think for hours, I would be oblivious to everything in the moment, except for my thoughts. I would think about what it would be like if I had never existed or how people would react to me committing su*c!de.</li>
		<li>With no intention of taking action on my thoughts, I would begin to think about how I would commit su*c!de, I would get adrenaline rushes, sweaty palms, and shaky. But still, I had no intention of doing anything. </li>
		<li>Still telling myself that I had no intention of doing anything, I then began to research pill combinations that are lethal. I would look up what ways of su*c!de had the highest success rate. I also researched what the most painless way to go was, which is what kept me from doing it for a while.</li>
		<li>As it worsened, my depression and anxiety intensified. I then started lying to everyone that supported me through this horrible mental illness, telling them I was okay while I devised a plan.</li>
		<li>After 1 failed overdose attempt, I went to the mental hospital. I got medicated and went to therapy.</li>
		<li>I started to get a little better, but life smacked me in the face again and I officially gave up. I bought a shotg0n and when that tri33er is pulled the suffering and awful feelings I have had for so long will finally go away and I will live peacefully with God, Grandpa and Priscilla in Heaven.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>*This is MY experience. A quitter, failure, and coward. Catch it early and find stuff that makes you happy. Stay strong and keep going.</p>
